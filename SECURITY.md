# Security Policy

WorkerFlow security focuses on ingress protection, secret hygiene, and replay-safe operational controls.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not open public issues for security-sensitive findings.

Report vulnerabilities privately to project maintainers and include:

- affected area and impact
- reproduction steps
- suggested remediation (if available)

## Scope

Security reports are especially important for:

- authentication and authorization paths
- secrets management and credential handling
- webhook ingress validation
- replay/retry and dead-letter endpoints
- connector auth and secret usage patterns
