# Packages

This directory contains modular extraction targets for WorkerFlow.

- `core-runtime`: target home for reusable runtime primitives.
- `handler-sdk`: stable contracts and registries for route/schedule handlers.
- `recipes-example`: public example routes/schedules.
- `recipes-joel`: placeholder package used as an example of private overlay recipes.

Current production-compatible runtime remains in `cloudflare/` while package extraction progresses.
