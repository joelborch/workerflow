# Packages

This directory contains modular extraction targets for WorkerFlow.

- `core-runtime`: extracted runtime primitives shared across adapters.
- `handler-sdk`: contracts and registries for building route/schedule handlers.
- `recipes-example`: generic public recipe bundle.
- `recipes-private`: placeholder/example for private overlay recipe packs.

Current production runtime still executes from `cloudflare/` while extraction continues.
