# Packages

This directory contains modular package scaffolding for the Cloudflare automation platform.

- `core-runtime`: shared runtime design and extraction target.
- `handler-sdk`: stable handler contracts and registry helpers.
- `recipes-example`: sanitized example handlers and manifests.
- `recipes-joel`: placeholder for private/business-specific recipes.

Existing production runtime remains under `cloudflare/` for compatibility during migration.
