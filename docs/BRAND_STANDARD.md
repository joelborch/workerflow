# Brand Standard

Use this standard when writing WorkerFlow docs, release notes, examples, and website copy.

## Core Positioning

WorkerFlow is a Cloudflare-native automation runtime that helps teams avoid high recurring automation SaaS spend and avoid running VPS infrastructure for event-driven workflows.

## Core Message Pillars

- cloudflare-native: built around Workers, Queues, D1, and Pages
- cost-aware: designed for low overhead and free-tier-friendly early usage
- control-first: your runtime, your secrets, your deploy pipeline
- agent-friendly: explicit contracts and setup docs for coding agents

## Tone

- direct and technical
- practical over hype
- explicit about limits and tradeoffs

## Preferred Terms

Use:

- "Cloudflare-native automation runtime"
- "self-hosted control plane"
- "free-tier-friendly for low-to-medium workloads"
- "event-driven, no always-on servers"

Avoid:

- absolute guarantees about pricing
- claims that every workload fits free tier
- vague "AI-powered" language without specific behavior

## Claim Safety

When referencing pricing/savings:

- frame as likely/typical for low-to-medium automation workloads
- include that limits and pricing can change by Cloudflare plan
