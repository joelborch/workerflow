# Roadmap

WorkerFlow roadmap focuses on an open, Cloudflare-native automation platform that starts lightweight and scales with contributor ecosystem growth.

## V1 (Current)

- stable execution core on Cloudflare workers
- starter route/schedule catalog
- contracts, fixture tests, smoke tests
- bootstrap and guard scripts

## V1.1

- richer public recipe library
- connector packs with clearer secret profiles
- typed recipe generation helpers via `handler-sdk`

## V1.2

- package extraction milestone (core-runtime parity)
- improved deployment presets and starter templates
- expanded ops APIs for replay filtering and timelines

## V2 (Target Direction)

- stronger multi-tenant reference architecture
- route-level policy plugins (auth/validation/rate limits)
- broader ecosystem around community recipes/connectors

## Active Contributor Queue
