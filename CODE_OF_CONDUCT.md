# Code of Conduct

This code of conduct applies to all WorkerFlow project spaces, including issues, pull requests, discussions, and chat channels.

## Our Standards

Contributors are expected to:

- Be respectful and constructive.
- Assume good intent.
- Focus feedback on ideas and implementation, not people.
- Avoid harassment, discrimination, and personal attacks.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers may remove or edit comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that violate this code of conduct.

Repeated or severe violations may result in temporary or permanent bans from project spaces.

## Reporting

Report incidents privately to the maintainers via the security contact process in `SECURITY.md`.
